            <h1>The <u class="sanimal">null</u> And The <u class="sAnotherAnimal"> null</u> </h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                A <u class="sanimal">null</u> was making fun of the <u class="sAnotherAnimal">null</u> one day for being so slow.
            </p>
            <p>"Do you ever get anywhere?"he asked with a mocking laugh</p>
            <p>
                "<u id="sradio">null</u>" replied the <u class="sAnotherAnimal">null</u>."but i get there <u id="sspeed" >null</u> than you think.i'll run you a race
                and prove it."
            </p>
            <p>
                The <u class="sanimal" >null</u> was much <u id="spast" >null</u> at the idea of running a race with the <u class="sAnotherAnimal">null</u>.but for the fun
                of the thing he agreed.so the <u id="smore" >null</u>,who had consented to act as judge,marked the distance
                yelled,"<u id="sQuote"> null</u>".
            </p>
            <p>
                The <u class="sanimal" >null</u> was soon far out of sight,and to make the <u class="sAnotherAnimal" >null</u> feel very deeply how ridiculous it
                was for him to try a race with a <u class="sanimal">null</u>.he went off the course to practice <u class="sverb" >null</u> for
                <u id="snum">null</u> hours until the <u class="sAnotherAnimal">null</u> should catch up.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <u class="sAnotherAnimal">null</u> meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily,and,after a time,passed the place where the
                <u class="sanimal">null</u> was <u class="sverb" >null</u>.The <u class="sanimal" >null</u> was so caught up in <u class="sverb" >null</u>;and when at last he did
                stop,the <u class="sAnotherAnimal">null</u> was near the goal.The <u class="sanimal" >null</u>now ran his swiftest, but could not overtake the
                <u class="sAnotherAnimal" >null</u> in time.
